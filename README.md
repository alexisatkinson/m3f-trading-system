# M3F Trading System


Crypto currency trading system for CoreCLR


This set of libraries provides the basic elements of
a crypto currency trading system. It currently features
connectivity to the GDAX exchange, but it should be 
fairly straight-forward to add more exchange backends.
There is also a simple _Akka.net_ actor wrapper that
should aid in writing trading bots.

## Project Layout

* *M3F.TradingSystem* contains the core classes and interfaces
  for consuming prices and operating on orders.
  _ITicker_ allows for top-of-book price subscriptions, while 
  _IOrderManager_ allows for placing orders as well as receiving
  order update notifications.

* *M3F.TradingSystem.Actors* contains a set of classes that
  work with the _Akka.net_ actor ecosystem. Making simple trading
  strategies is easier with the actor model.
  
* *M3F.TradingSystem.Gdax* implements connectivity to the GDAX
  exchange and provides several helper classes for extracting
  data out of GDAX.
  
* *mpm* (aka Money Printing Machine ðŸ˜‰) is an example application
  which uses GDAX backend in conjunction with the actor system
  to implement a simple _buy low, sell high_ bot.
